# Augmented-Chatbot
School textbooks are providing enough stuff to know about climate change to students. To make it more effective so that they can become aware of the global problem, we are designing an interactive solution that will present the whole text-book chapter in the form of conversation or narration. Augmented Reality chatbot is our solution.
